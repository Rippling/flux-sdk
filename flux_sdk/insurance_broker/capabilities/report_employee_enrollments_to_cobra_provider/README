This capability is responsible for accepting data that describes the companies benefits the lines which employees are enrolled in and returning a formated file to be sent to the 3rd party according to the app configuration. 


An simple implementation might look like
```
COLUMNS = [
    # column strings
]
def format_employee_enrollment_data(
        companyEnrollmentInfo: CompanyEnrollmentInfo,
        employee: list[Employee]
    ) -> File:
    csv_output = contextlib.closing(io.StringIO())
    writer = csv.DictWriter(csv_output, fieldnames=COLUMNS)

    for employee_enrollment in companyEnrollmentInfo.employeeEnrollments:
        row = {
            # define data for each column here
        }
        writer.writerow(row)

    file = File()
    file.name = # your file name
    file.content = csv_output.getvalue().encode()
    return file
```
